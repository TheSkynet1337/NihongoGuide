# **What is this Document?**

The following are my personal ramblings about learning languages, with a specific focus on Japanese. In it, I will discuss my opinions on learning languages in general \- some with citations and some not \- as well as how I went about learning Japanese, and how I think you should go about learning Japanese (or any language for that matter). What qualifies me to write this? Nothing; I have neither studied Japanese in a formal setting, nor have I attempted or passed any level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test or any other certification. However, as of writing this I have spent roughly seven years studying Japanese and thinking about language learning in general.

This document will begin with a section on language learning theory, then I will use that theory to come to conclusions on how you might learn Japanese. I will then discuss what your study goals for Japanese should probably be.

In the main body of this document I will give a guided tour through learning Japanese, the tour will be opinionated and written in hindsight from the perspective of someone who has been studying the language since 2017, whilst I will include the tools and methods I used, regularly my suggestions for what you should do will be different. A lot has happened in the self learning community over the last couple years and good new tools have become available.

Finally, I will include sections on each of the four main pillars of learning a language. The contents of these sections will overlap with their respective sections in the guide. Sometimes there might be further discussion on the topic of the section that is not relevant enough to make it into the guide itself.

###### **What is this Document not?**

It is not comprehensive. There are certainly other ways and methods to learn then are suggested here. It is not complete. This is definitely a work in progress and by no means a full brain dump of my language learning thoughts. I find it doubtful that it could ever be. If you have questions, you might know how to reach me, if you do feel free to ask away.

# **How do you learn a Language?**

The central pillar around which the learning methods described in this document are built is the idea of the 'Input hypothesis.' Most of the time the linguist [Stephen Krashen](https://youtu.be/NiTsduRreug) is credited with either coming up with this theory or at least popularizing it. So what does the input hypothesis state? The long and short of it is, that how humans of any age acquire language is not much different to how children learn it.

#### **Acquisition vs Learning**

In the context of the input hypothesis the idea of acquisition refers to the subconscious understanding of an element of a language. That might be the meaning of a word, the conjugation of a verb, or the tone of a given sentence. Whilst learning refers to conscious attempts at memorizing and understanding an element. Such as learning vocabulary using flashcards, doing conjugation drills, or training hearing of tones using minimal pairs.

Krashen proposes that learning can not lead to spontaneous understanding or output. Learned information can only be used to monitor the output and understanding of the subconscious. In other words the speed at which you can use learned information is simply insufficient for understanding or outputting at an acceptable level, speed here refers to words per minute not speed of learning.

Okay, so then how do you acquire language?

#### **Acquisition**

According to Krashen all language is acquired through comprehensible input. That is to say a bit of target language, what he often calls a message, of which the intended meaning can be understood. If I point at myself and say 'Ich' and then at an apple and say 'Apfel'. You are likely to acquire, at least temporarily, the German words for 'I' and 'apple.'

Another way of acquiring new language is through what Krashen calls `i+1` messages. These are messages in which a single piece of significant information is as of now unknown to you. Going on from the earlier example, if Ich pick up said Apfel, and whilst eating it tell you 'Ich esse den Apfel.' You might infer that 'esse den' means something to the effect of 'eat the.' Given the information you learned earlier you could decipher the sentence 'Ich esse den Apfel' to mean 'I eat the apple.'

Okay, but how do I acquire language? That is the neat part. You just did, or rather if you see similar examples a couple more times you will.

Input, made up of messages whose meaning is understandable whilst parts of the message are unknown, leads to subconscious acquisition of the unknown parts. All while reinforcing the known parts. While this is not necessarily accepted as the full truth by all linguists specializing in language learning, it is a reality that many language learners have acquired an exceptionally high level of their target language using these methods.

Sounds great, what is the catch? I am not selling you anything, no worries.

##### **About Time, Uncertainty and Caloric shortcuts**

Time, the big catch is time. I can not promise you fluency in 12 months, or being able to hold a conversation in 4 months. A child usually takes up to three years to reach a stage where they form multi word sentences. By no means does this mean you will take three years to do the same, but another part of Krashen's theory is that language acquisition happens in a similar order for every person. Whilst you might not follow the same timeline as a toddler, you are likely to have similar stages of development along the way. This guide will not be about learning Japanese before going on a vacation. This guide will be about making learning Japanese a part of your daily routine so that it may become a hobby, or if learning the language itself can't bring you that kind of joy at least supercharging the hobby that made you want to learn Japanese in the first place. As such, the methods outlined in this guide will probably take hundreds of hours before you realize their effects.

But this should not be discouraging, because if you are reading this you presumably learned English at some point. Either by being a child surrounded by English, or if you are like me, whilst killing time on the internet. Using input methods without intending to, or realizing you are doing it. You have almost certainly already gone through acquiring a language through input once (if not how are you consuming this?).

The only things stopping you from doing it again are adult problems. Adults, unlike children, don't want to, or simply can not spend hundreds of hours learning a language. They say they don't have time. Adults, unlike children, don't want to watch the content they consume in a language they don't understand without subtitles. Because adults dislike uncertainty, embracing the fact that you only understand parts of the content you consume as input is surprisingly difficult. Of course there are ways to cope with the uncertainty and I will discuss those later in this guide.

Another catch is, that it is my opinion that there are certain parts of a target language that you will simply not master through exclusively input, unless you are specifically primed to acquire them. This is likely because these parts of the language are not helpful when you are starting from an extremely low level. These parts are thus filtered out initially by your brain in order to focus on the parts that are helpful. These caloric shortcuts that your brain creates early on to speed up learning might be what leads to advanced learners having accents. A popular example of this in Japanese is the existence of pitch, and (western) learners' failure to acquire it through just input, but this too will be discussed in the guide.

# **What parts of Japanese should you learn?**

Unless you have some prior knowledge of Japanese this will be a strange question to pose. What parts of language X should you learn? If we are trying for native like fluency or at least native level understanding, all of them obviously, right? Well, Japanese has some special characteristics that make it uniquely suited to learning parts of the language. Many of the following concepts you will discover deeper in your journey of learning Japanese or in this guide, but a rough explanation in order for you to gain an understanding of what to focus on will be useful right away.

##### **Formality**

The Japanese language has multiple levels of formality, these include casual speech (tame-guchi), keigo (formal speech), sonkeigo (respectful speech), and kenjougo (humble speech). Unless you are planning to work in Japanese I suggest you keep sonkeigo and kenjougo on a need to know basis.

##### **Listening**

Even if you are only looking to use your Japanese for reading you are certain to profit off of doing listening based input. If you are looking to up your listening level above that of most learners it can be a good idea to start looking into pitch early, especially if your native language does not have pitch (this is the case for most germanic and romance languages).

##### **Reading**

Japanese has three writing systems. The two basic writing systems that exist in Japanese are Hiragana and Katakana or collectively Kana. These are referred to as syllabaries, unlike an alphabet each character represents a syllable not just a sound. That means if you can read the Kana you can theoretically read every word that could possibly exist in Japanese. These are mandatory to learn even if you don't ever intend to read actual Japanese content because most good sources for grammar and the like use Kana. Unless you are dead set on never reading anything that is above an elementary school level however, you will have to learn to read Kanji. Your goal should be to learn all of the Jouyou Kanji (roughly 2200 characters), don't be discouraged by that number, you have plenty of time and can simply do it on the side whilst acquiring other Japanese.

##### **Writing**

Writing can be split in two main categories: Hand writing and digitally writing using an input device. I suggest you learn to hand write Hiragana and your name in Katakana. This will initially make it easier to learn the Kana. Also, your name is the main thing you might ever be required to hand-write unless you are planning to live in Japan. I have not explicitly learned how to hand write Kanji and I suggest you do the same. I would still suggest you learn the basic stroke order rules at some point. This and reading will mean that you naturally acquire how to write some of the easiest most popular Kanji from memory. But you should learn how to use your PC or phone to digitally write Japanese. If you want to do written output I'd suggest doing it digitally.

##### **Speaking**

Unless you are planning on only ever consuming you will need to acquire speaking. If you want to minimize your eventual accent, look into pitch and if you are a native speaker of a germanic language (i.e. English) especially look into how to pronounce the Japanese R and Fu sounds. Most western learners have trouble acquiring these specific aspects of Japanese pronunciation through only input.

###### **So these are my suggestions on what to learn**

Everything, except for hand writing Kanji. Don't focus on learning or understanding higher levels of formal language early on, you will acquire it eventually.

# **A guide to learning Japanese**

This section will be a step-by-step guide on what to learn when. I will attempt to avoid giving time estimates of how long learning something might take because that can be very discouraging. Instead I will give estimates of absolute words/characters learned when giving prerequisites to moving on. But one time based estimate I can give right away is that acquiring Japanese is not something that you complete in a span of months. Acquiring any language takes years.

#### **Kana**

These will be your first steps. Congrats\~

My main suggestion is [NativShark](https://www.nativshark.com/). While it costs money, they teach the Kana and have follow-on content after that. As of right now NativShark is my favorite choice for learning Kana, Vocabulary, Kanji, and grammar. Substitute by doing Tofugu's [Kana practice](https://kana-quiz.tofugu.com/) or [Real Kana](https://realkana.com/study). If you can memorize them better by hand writing, do that. Another option that is free is Anki with an appropriate deck for Hiragana and Katakana. There are roughly 70 Hiragana and for each a corresponding Katakana. If you manage a couple a day it should not take you long until you have seen all of them at least once. Learning to read these will be a prerequisite to any good reading based study from now on so the faster you finish these the better.

Once you know all Hiragana you can move on to learning Kanji and vocabulary.

Stuff to do in parallel:

* Passive listening

#### **Vocabulary and Kanji**

Use a spaced repetition system to start learning the most used words. I suggest you don't spend a huge amount of time on which service to use or setting it up. Starting with some new words each day and building the habit is the important part. Maybe get an accountability buddy.

Notes on spaced-repetition use:

For Kanji do not learn all the readings or meanings for a given character. Instead for each Kanji learn a meaning. Then learn some vocabulary using that Kanji. Learning a vocabulary means learning its meaning in the context you are seeing it in and also its reading in that context. This way you will learn the readings of the Kanji passively through the vocabulary they are used in. Also unless you do WaniKani you will be grading yourself when reviewing cards. In general you should prefer hitting 'I got that right' over 'I got that wrong.' Know the reading of the word but only have a rough idea of the meaning of the whole sentence on the card? Sounds like you got it right. Slightly off on the reading but knew the meaning of the word in the context of the sentence. Yep, you got that right. For Kanji that have multiple meanings, grade yourself as correct if you knew one of them or came up with something conceptually close. The point of these cards is to create an entry for the word or Kanji in your brain, filling the entry in with correct information happens during immersion.

If you want to be able to hand write Kanji this is where you have to diverge from what I would suggest and use Heisig's Remembering the Kanji instead (Vol. 1 and 3\. skip Vol. 2.). See writing section for further discussion.

My suggestion:

* [NativShark](https://www.nativshark.com/) (monthly or lifetime): teaches Kana, Kanji, Grammar and vocabulary.

* [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/) (monthly or lifetime): teaches Kanji and vocabulary, you should supplement this with a 3k deck as their vocabulary is not necessarily everyday type stuff.

Other useful tools:

* [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (free): get a [3k deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks?search=Japanese%20Core&sort=rating) with audio that has the word in a sentence on the front and a translation on the back, no need to go too fancy.

* [JPDB](https://jpdb.io/) (free): teaches Kanji and vocabulary based on frequency in a given piece of content.

* [Migaku](https://migaku.com/) (monthly or lifetime): They have a from 0 course but I don't know its quality, this is in this list because it is a great tool for making your own flashcards once you are at the intermediary/advanced level

Once you have seen roughly one hundred words you can probably move on to learning grammar. You can start earlier but you will end up not knowing a large portion of the vocabulary used in the grammar guides you read, which can be distracting. The more vocabulary and Kanji you can bear to grind out before moving on the easier the next stages will be, but don't wait longer than 150 Kanji or 750 words. You will be doing spaced repetition based vocabulary learning for a long time. That is to say keep learning new vocabulary and doing reviews whilst doing the steps after this. You might decide to stop using spaced repetition at the point where your knowledge is comprehensive enough that simply looking up words in a dictionary is enough to prime them for acquisition at a later time. Similar to how you might learn new words in your native language. That might seem like an absurd thing to you now, but trust me when I say that this point will come on its own if you make spaced repetition and immersion a part of your daily routine.

Stuff to do in parallel:

* Passive listening  
* Finish learning Katakana

#### **Grammar**

You can probably learn all of grammar through immersion. But one of the few advantages we have as an adult learner of a language is that we can actively study things and make connections between parts of the language that a child will not be making. Basic grammar study will also help as a spring board to get to effective immersion faster. There are two main ways to acquire grammar.

You can study the traditional way by reading lessons, doing conjugation drills, and learning rules while supported by flashcards. The things you learn here will then be reinforced and acquired when you recognise them in input during immersion. Alternatively you can read a grammar guide and trust that awareness of the existence of the grammar, immersion and sentence cards in your spaced repetition will lead to acquisition. The second method will initially take longer but depending on how much studying you can bear it might end up being more enjoyable.

It might not seem that way to a native speaker of a European language at first, but Japanese grammar is extremely regular and not that complicated actually. The large difference in mental model that it requires will make Japanese grammar feel very strange at first. I suggest you sit through this feeling and think of it as building your ['Japanese Brain.'](https://youtu.be/PBAYCbL3lEc)

My suggestions:

* [CureDol Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSvH9vH60Ig&list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj) (free): Without a doubt the best grammar videos I have seen on YouTube. The voice-over audio quality can be lacking but subtitles are available.

* [NativShark](https://www.nativshark.com/) (monthly or lifetime): Grammar lessons are usually a light explanation of meaning and nuance and some example sentences.

Other Options:

* [Tae Kim's Guide](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/category/grammar-guide/basic-grammar/) (free): This is a genuine classic, I would suggest this for light grammar reading. Read the lesson and examples but skip the exercises. Or do them if you feel like doing drills.

* [Bunpro](https://bunpro.jp/) (monthly or lifetime): This is a service that offers a spaced repetition system for grammar, there are explanations and examples for each grammar point and then flash cards where you fill in the correct grammar form. This boosted my grammar knowledge around advanced grammar (N2 level) when I did it originally. If you already feel like you are doing too much flashcard reviews don't start this. If you are studying to take a certification this is probably good.

Once you have learned basic grammar, a couple hundred words, and a couple hundred Kanji it is time to start acquiring via active immersion. You can probably move on earlier if you start out doing comprehensible input stuff for immersion.

Stuff to do in parallel:

* Passive listening  
* Learning Vocabulary  
* Learning Kanji

#### **Immersion**

This is the initially painful but eventually fun part of learning a language. Immersion in this context does not refer to living in Japan or being there.

Immersion is the act of getting input in Japanese. Getting input is what most of your study time should be used for. The act of immersing might refer to watching a video, an episode of a show, a podcast, or reading something. For this to be effective, getting a translation has to have some friction, so your brain will actually try to understand the content instead of just using the translation as a crutch. That means no subtitles whilst watching and no flipping subtitles on-and-off after each sentence 'to make sure I understood it.'

You can generally immerse via listening to spoken Japanese (music unfortunately does not make for great input content, I think) or reading. Meaningfully immersing in written Japanese will be impossible for quite some time as such we will focus on listening based immersion initially. When talking about getting listening input the community often refers to two modes, active and passive.

##### **Passive Immersion or Passive Listening**

Passive immersion is listening to content without fully focusing on it. A podcast open in the background whilst doing something else. A video on the second monitor. Some people even listen to something whilst sleeping (I have listened to all of [hiikibiiki](https://archive.org/details/hikibiki_podcast) multiple times and have no recollection of the content).

Passive immersion might be especially useful early on, when it might be hard to find motivation to do active immersion. Doing passive immersion will allow your brain to learn the different sounds of Japanese. When words and sentences end and begin. If you use something like a podcast where people are talking to each other you will learn the unique rhythm of Japanese conversation. And every now and then whilst listening you might go: Oh hey, I know that word it means X.

##### **Active Immersion**

Active immersion is when you are consuming something and are trying to get invested in the content, you make it main monitor content. You are intently listening. This is where you will have to learn to accept uncertainty, because it is very unlikely you will understand the content you are trying to get invested into. I suggest you start out by re-watching some of your favorite stuff but without subtitles this time. You might also read the synopsis of each episode before watching it, this way you already know the gist of what is going on. If you want to watch something new you could watch the episode like normal with subtitles and then immediately re-watch it without. Don't be disappointed if you don't understand something. Be kind to yourself, especially early on. Initially you might only catch a couple words in an episode, or recognise a sentence structure. Eventually you will end up simply understanding what is being said. You might not even be able to translate it, but you understand the content.

My suggestions for early Audio immersion:

* 'Comprehensible Input' such as [CIJapanese](https://cijapanese.com/watch) or YouTube videos, even better if you can find them without forced English subtitles.  
* Watch [this](https://youtu.be/FPsg6sdrN6M) by Matt, he explains the typical hole that immersion learners hit after using comprehensible input for a while and suggests ideas to get over it.  
* Slice of Life Anime you have seen before. Stuff like Flying Witch. These shows are meant to be comfortable and easy to watch. A younger target audience will mean the content is easier.  
* Be careful with Sci-Fi and Fantasy, that stuff is hard and filled with made up words.  
* Anything you can get yourself to watch and pay attention to without subtitles.

I will repeat here, this will be painful for many hours. But this and the vocab flashcards are where you make the most gains, it just really does not feel like that early on.

If you care about having a good accent later on, this is the time when you should make yourself aware of pitch accent. [Dogen's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6AoilGEers&list=PLxMXdmBM9wPvsySiMoBzgh8d68xqKz1YP) are a classic suggestion here. Anything beyond the free videos on YouTube is most likely unnecessary. Awareness is really all we are going for here so don't memorize the rules beyond the most basic ones. Once you are aware what pitch is, do Kotu.io's [Minimal Pairs Test](https://kotu.io/tests/pitchAccent/perception/minimalPairs) after you finish your spaced-repetition reviews. Just a couple minutes each day. Eventually you will start noticing the pitch accent of words in your immersion. If you don't start doing this early you will have to either correct it later or live with having a bad accent, because you will likely not become capable of hearing pitch unless your native language has tones. We are trying to stop you from building a caloric shortcut. So even if this does not seem immediately useful it is a good idea to do.

##### **When do I start immersing through reading?**

The longer you wait the better your accent will likely be. But if you are like me you enjoy reading Manga too much to wait long. Also learning Kanji is like a hack that allows you to read content that other learners complain about being hard, so obviously you want to abuse that power. Anyways, a fourth grader should know roughly six hundred Kanji and an appropriate amount of vocabulary. So there you go, that is a number. If you know that much you can probably read anything that is targeting up to middle schoolers. But honestly you should just occasionally try to read something that seems enjoyable. My suggestions for starting out:

* Slice of Life Manga. The classic suggestion is 'Yotsubato\!'. You can find vocabulary lists for it online and if you feel like you could read it without looking up every single word, then give it a shot.

* Minimize Dictionary lookups, try to limit yourself to a certain amount of lookups per page. Make that number uncomfortably small so you end up reading the whole page before deciding what to look up, instead of just looking up each word you don't know immediately. Like, two lookups per Manga page small.

* Read in a way where lookups are easy, looking up a word for which you don't know the reading or the Kanji can be tough. Reading stuff with Furigana (the small Kana above/next to the word that spell out the reading) and reading digitally make looking up stuff way easier.

* Use a good dictionary: [Jisho](https://jisho.org/) or [Jotoba](https://jotoba.de/) in the browser. Or [Takoboto](https://takoboto.jp/apps/) on your phone. Turn on pitch graphs in Takoboto for bonus points.

* Avoid Novels early, books are great at an intermediate level because they use a lot of descriptive language that you are probably lacking from audio immersion and Manga. But this descriptive language can be really tough early on.

##### **How much time should I be spending on what?**

Honestly this is up to you but probably at least an equal amount of time on spaced-repetition and immersion. The more immersion the better.

I think a ranking of importance so you can figure out what not to skip on a given day might make more sense. In order of most important to least important:

spaced-repetition Reviews \-\> Immersion \-\> New Words in spaced-repetition \-\> New Kanji in spaced-repetition

##### **And there you are…**

Welcome to the hamster wheel. As long as you keep spinning the 'spaced-repetition for learning, immersion for acquisition' flywheel your learning will accelerate. At this point you can do whatever you want. But if you want efficiency you can focus your immersion and new vocabulary on a certain genre of show, eventually you will find that more and more sentences in each episode only have one unknown element or even none. Once you feel you have mastered a certain genre of show, you can use that to branch out to adjacent things. Know everything there is to know about daily life at a high school and want to know more language about beating people up? Watch high schoolers beating people up (I don't know, 'Hajime no Ippo' or 'Wind Breaker' or something). Romance can also be a good genre to branch out to, from Slice of Life for something with more drama.

Once you reach the intermediate level point of being able to understand most everything in a certain genre it should always be possible to ladder out of that genre into another one using the spaced-repetition and immersion (using a site like [JPDB](https://jpdb.io/anime-difficulty-list) to learn all the common words you don't know in a show can be useful here). If you have reached this point you don't really need this guide anymore, for you to reach this level, learning the language is either a strong habit or a hobby. Immersing in content you enjoy should be nearly as easy as just watching stuff in your native language. Note, that I'm talking about the ease of immersing in it here, not the ease of understanding it. Again don't be too hard on yourself. At this point keeping the motivation up to keep doing the spaced-repetition might be the more difficult part, but hopefully you either gain that motivation through the knowledge and lived experience that it helps your immersion, or you simply have formed the habit of doing it.

##### **And that's it folks\~**

Wait, you're done? What about speaking?

#### **Speaking**

The guide on actually acquiring Japanese ended in the last part.

Because speaking is not practice, learning, or acquisition. Speaking is application.

Simply put, you will not acquire new Japanese by speaking it. The reason conversations with other people can be perceived as good practice is because you will inevitably be fully immersed in what the other person is saying. You are after all, most likely, desperately trying to come up with a sensible response.

But I will give the following advice on speaking. If you don't have a reason to start speaking, wait. The longer you can keep your silent period the better your eventual accent will be. This might sound contradictory, but remember that speaking does not practice your accent. Hearing native speakers speaking and acquiring the way they say things does. Speaking simply fossilizes habits. Note, that this is only true if you actually do an appropriate amount of audio immersion, if you eventually do way more reading than listening you will end up reading to yourself in your head (This is referred to as subvocalization). This can have a similar effect to fossilizing a bad accent as speaking.

If you find yourself wanting to speak, or having to speak by a certain time you might want to do some things in preparation for that day:

If you are a native speaker of a European language, look up how to correctly pronounce the Japanese 'R' sounds, the 'Fu' sound, the 'u' and 'o' sounds, and the 'Yu.' Look up how your mouth and tongue should be moving when doing these. Look at native speakers' lips when they make these sounds, unfortunately these are going to need to be non-animated real people (Yuck). Your intuition is likely to be wrong here even after immersion. Once you look this up and do it correctly you will probably notice when you do it wrong yourself. Also start speaking out loud to yourself or a recording device a decent amount of time before going into a conversation. You might well find that you end up blabbing a little bit, or slurring sounds that should not be slurred. You need to get your mouth to do the right movements and that will probably take some tries. Again fast consecutive 'R' sounds can be a real pain-point here. The first time I spoke Japanese out loud was when I first tried to speak to a Japanese person, they might have been entertained by the whole thing but I wasn't.

## **Help the spaced-repetition is killing me**

There will be a time at which the spaced-repetition seems unbearable. Maybe you didn't do it for a couple days. Maybe you don't want to learn new words whilst on vacation. If you are here because you are feeling the squeeze, read [this](https://help.nativshark.com/ask/the_dangers_of_resetting).

Here is my tip: If you are not in your first months of learning and find yourself just not feeling it for a day. Just don't learn new words, but do your reviews. Skipping reviews should be the very last thing you do. They will just keep piling up (I had over 1500 cards to review when I returned from my last vacation). But whatever you do do not reset the spaced-repetition, if you have a mountain of reviews piling up just do some every day and stop learning new words while you work on it. Even if you only manage just enough so the overall number of reviews you have tomorrow is the same as today.
